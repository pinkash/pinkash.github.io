            {
                hindi: "जागृत मानव कर्म करते समय स्वतंत्र तथा फल भोगते समय भी स्वतंत्र है।",
                english: "The awakened human is free while performing actions and also free while experiencing the results.",
                interpretation: "This quote distinguishes between a state of living in delusion versus living with awareness. A person bound by illusion acts out of compulsion and feels trapped by the consequences. In contrast, an 'awakened' individual acts from a place of understanding and choice. They are not a victim of circumstance but a conscious creator of their reality, accepting outcomes without being psychologically bound by them. This is the essence of true freedom."
            },
            {
                hindi: "मानव सही में एक तथा गलती में अनेक है।",
                english: "In correctness, humanity is one; in error, it is many.",
                interpretation: "This profound statement suggests that truth and universal principles (correctness) unite humanity. When we operate from a place of universal values like justice, truth, and compassion, we find common ground. However, when we are driven by individual delusions, fears, and misunderstandings (errors), we create division, conflict, and fragmentation. The path to unity lies in aligning with universal truths."
            },
            {
                hindi: "जो कृतज्ञ नहीं है, वह मानव संस्कृति व सभ्यता का वाहक बनने का प्रमाण प्रस्तुत नहीं कर सकता।",
                english: "One who is not grateful cannot present evidence of being a carrier of human culture and civilization.",
                interpretation: "Gratitude is presented here not just as a polite emotion, but as a foundational pillar of civilization. It signifies the recognition of our interconnectedness and the contributions of others and nature to our existence. An ungrateful person is self-centered and cannot uphold the cooperative and respectful spirit that is essential for a thriving, humane culture."
            },
            {
                hindi: "न्याय, धर्म एवं सत्यपूर्ण व्यवहार ही एकसूत्रता का सूत्र है।",
                english: "Behavior that is filled with justice, righteousness, and truth is the formula for unity.",
                interpretation: "Unity is not achieved through force or superficial agreements, but through a shared commitment to fundamental principles. Justice (fairness in relationships), Dharma (righteous conduct aligned with natural laws), and Truth (alignment with reality) are the threads that weave society together. When these principles guide our actions, we create a harmonious and unified existence."
            },
            {
                hindi: "भ्रमित मानव ही कर्म करते समय स्वतन्त्र एवम्‌ फल भोगते समय परतन्त्र है।",
                english: "The deluded human is independent while performing an action, but dependent when bearing its fruit.",
                interpretation: "This highlights the paradox of acting without understanding. A person driven by ego or illusion feels free to do as they please. However, because their actions are not aligned with reality, they become entangled in the unexpected and often painful consequences. They become a slave to the results of their own 'free' actions. True freedom involves understanding the action and its potential outcome."
            },
            {
                hindi: "जिसके पास जो होगा, वह उसे बाँटेगा ही।",
                english: "Whatever one has, one will inevitably distribute it.",
                interpretation: "This simple sentence carries deep psychological weight. It means that our inner state—be it peace, anger, knowledge, or confusion—naturally radiates outwards and affects others. A person filled with turmoil will spread turmoil, while a person with inner peace will share that peace. It underscores the responsibility we have for cultivating our inner world, as it becomes our contribution to the outer world."
            },
            {
                hindi: "समझ को प्रगट न करना या न कर सकना या समझ सम्पन्न नहीं हो पाना ही रहस्य है।",
                english: "Not expressing understanding, being unable to express it, or not achieving it in the first place, is the only mystery.",
                interpretation: "This demystifies the concept of 'mystery.' The text suggests that reality itself is not mysterious, but knowable. The only 'mystery' is our own lack of understanding or our inability to articulate what we know. The solution is not to worship the unknown, but to pursue clarity and the ability to express it, thereby eliminating the mystery."
            },
            {
                hindi: "अनुभव ही प्रमाण परम प्रमाण ही समझ ज्ञान समझ ही प्रत्यक्ष, प्रत्यक्ष ही समाधान।",
                english: "Experience is the proof; the ultimate proof is understanding and knowledge; understanding is direct perception, and direct perception is the solution.",
                interpretation: "This outlines the process of true knowing. It's not based on belief, but on a direct, experiential path. True 'Experience' leads to deep 'Understanding' (knowledge). This understanding allows for 'Direct Perception' of reality as it is, without illusion. Seeing things clearly, as they are, is the ultimate 'Solution' to all problems, which are rooted in misunderstanding."

            {
                hindi: "भूमि स्वर्ग हो, मानव देवता हो, धर्म सफल हो, नित्य शुभ हो।",
                english: "May the Earth become heaven, may humans become divine, may righteousness be successful, may there be eternal auspiciousness.",
                interpretation: "This is a benediction that outlines the ultimate potential of existence. It's not a prayer for an afterlife, but a vision for this life. Earth becomes 'heaven' through right action, humans become 'divine' by realizing their true nature, and 'righteousness' (Dharma) succeeding leads to a state of perpetual well-being."
            },
            {
                hindi: "व्यवस्था ही विकास एवं जागृति।",
                english: "Order itself is evolution and awakening.",
                interpretation: "This connects the cosmic and the personal. 'Order' (Vyavastha) refers to the inherent, self-organized system of existence. Aligning with this natural order is the very process of 'evolution' (vikas) and 'awakening' (jagruti). Chaos and suffering arise from moving against this inherent order."
            },
            {
                hindi: "नियम ही न्याय, न्याय ही धर्म, धर्म ही सत्य, सत्य ही ऐश्वर्य।",
                english: "Law is justice, justice is righteousness, righteousness is truth, truth is abundance.",
                interpretation: "This presents a causal chain of principles. Universal 'Laws' (Niyam) are the basis for 'Justice' (Nyay). Living justly is 'Righteousness' (Dharma). The nature of righteousness is 'Truth' (Satya). Living in truth leads to true 'Abundance' (Aishwarya), which is not just material wealth but a state of complete fulfillment in coexistence."
            },
            {
                hindi: "जागृति का प्रमाण अमानवीयता से मानवीयता।",
                english: "The proof of awakening is the transformation from inhumanity to humanity.",
                interpretation: "Awakening is not an abstract concept but a tangible shift in behavior. The primary evidence that one is 'awakening' is moving away from cruel, selfish, and divisive actions ('inhumanity') towards behavior characterized by compassion, justice, and understanding ('humanity')."
            },
            {
                hindi: "मानव, मानव के साथ संघर्ष करने के लिये, प्रत्येक संगठित इकाई अपनी सभ्यता एवं संस्कृति को श्रेष्ठ मानने के आधार पर स्वत्व और सम्पत्तिकरण के विस्तारीकरण को न्याय-सम्मत स्वीकार लेता है।",
                english: "To struggle with another human, every organized unit accepts the expansion of its ownership and property as just, based on believing its own civilization and culture to be superior.",
                interpretation: "This is a sharp critique of the root cause of conflict. It argues that wars and struggles begin with the belief in one's own cultural or ideological superiority. This belief is then used to justify the 'just' expansion of power, wealth, and territory at the expense of others."
            },
            {
                hindi: "धर्म सामरस्यता ही मानव में अखंडता है।",
                english: "Harmony in righteousness (Dharma) is the integrity within humanity.",
                interpretation: "True unity ('integrity' or 'wholeness') among people doesn't come from shared race, language, or geography. It comes from 'Dharma Samrasyata' - a shared harmony and understanding of the universal principles of living. When people align with these fundamental truths of existence, they become united."
            },
            {
                hindi: "स्वयम्‌ का मूल्यांकन कर लो- गलती अपराध नहीं करोगे फलत: दुःखी, प्रताड़ित और दरिद्र नहीं होगे।",
                english: "Evaluate yourself - you will not make mistakes or commit crimes, and consequently, you will not be sad, tormented, or impoverished.",
                interpretation: "This places the responsibility for one's state of being firmly on self-reflection. Suffering ('sadness, torment, poverty') is not random but a direct result of 'mistakes and crimes' born from a lack of self-awareness. The path to a fulfilled life begins with honest self-evaluation."
            },
            {
                hindi: "मानव जाति एक, कर्म अनेक।",
                english: "The human race is one, the actions are many.",
                interpretation: "This statement emphasizes a fundamental unity while acknowledging diversity. At our core, we are all part of a single human family. The differences we see are in our 'actions' (karma), which are shaped by our varying levels of understanding and delusion. The goal is to align our diverse actions with the singular truth of our shared humanity."
            },
            {
                hindi: "मानव धर्म एक, समाधान अनेक।",
                english: "The human purpose (Dharma) is one, the solutions are many.",
                interpretation: "The fundamental purpose or nature (Dharma) of a human being—to live in a state of resolution and happiness—is universal. However, the specific paths and 'solutions' (samadhan) to achieve this state can be diverse, tailored to individual circumstances and levels of understanding."
            },
            {
                hindi: "जीवन नित्य, जन्म-मृत्यु एक घटना।",
                english: "Life is eternal, birth and death are an event.",
                interpretation: "This distinguishes the eternal consciousness ('Life' or 'Jeevan') from the temporary physical body. 'Life' itself does not begin or end. 'Birth and death' are merely events related to the physical form that consciousness inhabits. This perspective shifts focus from fearing death to understanding the nature of eternal consciousness."
            },
            {
                hindi: "जागृति पूर्वक अभिव्यक्तियाँ समझदार मानव परम्परा।",
                english: "Expressions that come from a place of awakening create the tradition of a wise humanity.",
                interpretation: "A truly wise and sustainable human tradition is not built on technology or power, but on the collective expressions of awakened individuals. When people act, speak, and create from a state of clear understanding, they contribute to a culture of wisdom that can be passed down through generations."
            },
            {
                hindi: "कृतज्ञता ही मूलतः संस्कृति व सभ्यता का आधारग्राही एवं संरक्षक मूल्य है।",
                english: "Gratitude is fundamentally the value that grasps and protects the basis of culture and civilization.",
                interpretation: "This elevates gratitude from a simple feeling to a cornerstone of society. It is the 'value' that allows us to recognize our debt to the past, to nature, and to each other. This recognition is what 'grasps' the essence of culture and motivates us to 'protect' and build upon it for the future."
            },
            {
                hindi: "जो जैसा है उसको वैसा जानना, मानना एवं पहचानना ही निर्भ्रान्त स्थिति की उपलब्धि है।",
                english: "To know, accept, and recognize that which is, as it is, is the achievement of a delusion-free state.",
                interpretation: "This is the definition of clarity. A state free from delusion ('nirbhrant') is not about having mystical visions, but about the simple, profound ability to see reality without the distortion of our own fears, desires, and prejudices. The goal is to align our perception with what is actually there."
            },
            {
                hindi: "सत्यता का अध्ययन पूर्ण हो जाना ही निर्भ्रमता है।",
                english: "The completion of the study of reality is the state of being delusion-free.",
                interpretation: "Being free from delusion is not a gift but the result of a process: the 'study of reality' (satyata ka adhyayan). This 'study' involves observing existence, understanding its laws, and seeing our place within it. When this understanding is complete, delusion naturally dissolves."
            },
            {
                hindi: "अनुभव मात्र सत्य सहज ही है क्योंकि यह अपरिवर्तनीय है।",
                english: "Experience is only of truth itself, because it is unchanging.",
                interpretation: "This defines what constitutes true 'experience' (anubhav). It is not fleeting sensory pleasure or emotional highs and lows. True experience is the direct perception of 'truth' (satya), which is the unchanging, eternal aspect of reality. Anything that changes is a phenomenon, not the underlying truth."
            },
            {
                hindi: "नियम अपरिवर्तनीय है, इसलिये नियम सत्य एवं नित्य सिद्ध है।",
                english: "The law is unchangeable, therefore the law is proven to be true and eternal.",
                interpretation: "The underlying laws of existence (niyam) — physical, chemical, and conscious — are not human inventions and do not change. Because they are constant and universal, they are synonymous with 'truth' (satya) and 'eternity' (nitya). Understanding these laws is key to aligning with reality."
            },
            {
                hindi: "सत्यबोध के बिना सत्यानुभूति तथा सत्यानुभूति के बिना विश्राम नहीं है।",
                english: "Without the knowledge of truth there is no experience of truth, and without the experience of truth there is no rest.",
                interpretation: "This outlines the path to 'rest' (vishram), which means a state of complete resolution and peace. It begins with 'knowledge of truth' (Satyabodh), which is intellectual understanding. This must mature into a direct 'experience of truth' (Satyanubhuti). Only this direct experience can bring an end to the inner turmoil and seeking that defines the human condition."
            },
            {
                hindi: "सत्य, मात्र सत्ता में सम्पुक्त जड़ चैतन्य प्रकृति ही है।",
                english: "Truth is nothing but the material and conscious nature saturated in the all-pervading existence.",
                interpretation: "This is a core metaphysical statement. 'Truth' (Satya) is not an abstract concept. It is the totality of reality: the 'material' (jad) and 'conscious' (chaitanya) nature, which are inseparable from and 'saturated in' the ultimate, all-pervading reality (Satta). Coexistence is the fundamental truth."
            },
            {
                hindi: "अहंकार एवं भ्रम यह दोनों सत्यता के प्रति अनर्हता के द्योतक हैं।",
                english: "Ego and delusion are both indicators of ineligibility for truth.",
                interpretation: "The path to understanding truth has prerequisites. The presence of 'ego' (ahankar) — the false sense of a separate self — and 'delusion' (bhram) — a distorted view of reality — makes one 'ineligible' to perceive truth. One must first work on dissolving these obstacles."
            },
            {
                hindi: "सुख एक बौद्धिक स्थिति है।",
                english: "Happiness is an intellectual state.",
                interpretation: "This statement challenges the common notion that happiness comes from external objects or sensory pleasures. Instead, it posits that true, lasting happiness ('sukh') is a 'boudhik sthiti' - a state of the intellect, a state of understanding. It is the result of having resolved all questions and contradictions within oneself."
            },
            {
                hindi: "शोषण तथा पोषण भेद से ही मानव गुरु-मूल्यन व लघु-मूल्यन प्रक्रिया को संपन्न करता है।",
                english: "It is through the distinction between exploitation and nourishment that a human completes the process of assigning higher or lower value.",
                interpretation: "This explains how we form our values. Our actions are either 'nourishing' (poshan) — contributing to order and mutual fulfillment — or 'exploitative' (shoshan) — causing disorder and harm. By observing the results of these two types of actions, we learn to assign 'higher value' (guru-mulyan) to what is nourishing and 'lower value' (laghu-mulyan) to what is exploitative."
            },
            {
                hindi: "विचार पक्ष का परिमार्जन मात्र चित के प्रत्यावर्तन से ही संभव है।",
                english: "The purification of the faculty of thought is possible only through the returning of the faculty of contemplation (chitta).",
                interpretation: "This describes a key process in consciousness. 'Purifying our thoughts' (vichar) isn't about suppressing them. It requires the 'returning' (pratyavartan) of our deeper faculty of 'contemplation/imagination' (chitta) from being focused on the external world of sensations to the internal world of understanding. When our contemplation is aligned with truth, our thoughts naturally become harmonious."
            },
            {
                hindi: "जो जिसका मूल्यांकन नहीं करेगा वह उसका सदुपयोग नहीं करेगा या नहीं कर सकेगा।",
                english: "One who does not evaluate something will not, or cannot, make good use of it.",
                interpretation: "Proper use (sadupayog) stems from correct evaluation (mulyankan). Whether it's a relationship, a natural resource, or one's own talent, we cannot use it correctly until we understand its true nature, purpose, and value. Misuse and abuse stem from incorrect or non-existent evaluation."
            },
            {
                hindi: "मानव के लिए सुख ही धर्म है।",
                english: "For a human, happiness itself is their nature (Dharma).",
                interpretation: "This is a radical redefinition of 'Dharma'. It is not a set of external rules, but the innate nature of a being. The intrinsic nature and purpose of a human being is to exist in a state of continuous happiness, which is achieved through resolution and understanding. To be unhappy is to be unnatural."
            },
            {
                hindi: "पुरुष का जीवन यतित्व से सफल है। स्त्रीका जीवन सतीत्व से सफल है।",
                english: "A man's life is successful through self-control (yatitva). A woman's life is successful through devotion to truth (satitva).",
                interpretation: "This defines success in terms of inner qualities, not external achievements. 'Yatitva' implies disciplined effort and self-mastery. 'Satitva' implies a steadfast devotion to 'Sat' or Truth. Both point to a life where success is measured by one's alignment with higher principles and self-realization, leading to a harmonious and purposeful existence for both men and women."
            },

A successful friendship is not just about enjoyment but about mutually 'demonstrating' a life of 'all-round resolution' (complete understanding).

It is a state that arises from two things: the 'absence of fear' that comes from understanding, and a deep 'trust in the present' (vartaman mein vishwas). It is the stability that comes from being grounded in reality, free from anxieties about the past or future."

                interpretation: "True 'valor' or 'heroism' (veerta) is not about aggression or dominance. It is defined ethically as using one's own strengths—be they physical, intellectual, or material—for the purpose of ensuring that 'another' receives 'justice'.

It is the process ('kriyakalap') of freeing oneself from 'fear' and achieving 'liberation from toil' (shram-mukti) — the inner struggle and striving that characterizes a deluded state.

                interpretation: "True 'generosity' (udarata) is more than just giving things away. It stems from a state of inner 'resolution' and 'prosperity'.

                interpretation: "This provides a concise definition. 'Happiness' (sukh) is 'resolution' (samadhan) — the state of having no inner questions or contradictions. 'Vigor' or 'energy' (sphurti) is the natural outcome of this state; it is the 'inclination' and energy to act in ways that prove and express that inner resolution."

The 'mother' principle is 'nourishment' (poshan) — providing the substance for growth.

It occurs when an interaction results in one 'unit' (a person, the environment) being diminished or losing something that is 'favorable' to its existence. It is a win-lose interaction that creates imbalance."

                interpretation: "True 'unity' (ekasutrata) is not about uniformity or conformity.

It suggests that anger is not a sign of strength, but a 'display of one's own incompetence' (akshamata). It arises when we are unable to manage a situation or ourselves through understanding and skill, and so we resort to the crude expression of anger."
